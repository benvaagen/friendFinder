DEPLOYED @ https://friend-finder-benjamin-vaagen.herokuapp.com

This homework required us to build a compatability-based "Love Link" application. The application to results from different users surveys, compared their answers with other users, and then displayed the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing and deployed to Heroku.

I focused on learning the backend aspects of this assignment, and only applied minimal CSS.
I am proud to see and say that it works. I have learned so much in the few months that I have been here, and I am starting to feel more confident in my abilities.
